# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?
Creating a file through cmd with the touch command, html and a css file. Then copying and pasting the source code into them and saving it. 


### Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?

I defintely went way over the time box!! man it takes discipline to stay focused as this is such a broad subject with so many rabbit holse! I do however feel i acheieved the learning competenicies . 



# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones? 
I compared the first few lessons between Udemy and freedcodecamp, i prefered the text based learning of freecodecamp becuase it allowed me to go at my own pace, sometimes i felt the videos were a bit slow. I went through the freecodecamp.org Basic HTML and HTML5 , and Basic CSS courses. At first, it was a bit difficult to understand the way the wrote the lessons, but after a while it seemed quite natural, but i did notice sometimes the interfaced was bugged. I would often type the exact code right, then it wouldnt work, i would copy out the example and change the text and it would work after. I also used alot of googling to expand on some of the lessons if i felt i didn't understand.  


### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
Sometimes some of the jargon after a few hours of reading would all mould into one , to be honest i don't know how much i will remember. I made my way through freecodecamps css and html beginner courses. I guess the obstacles I faced was remembering everything and still do face it. i think only by putting the things i learn to use constantly i will remember them and truly understand the "why" of the function. 


### What are of you proud of from during this challenge?
Sticking at it, sometimes it felt tediuos going through and learning seemingly endless functions of CSS , but it was great when i could then use what i had learnt in building a website and it actaully worked! 


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?
No, i sepnt about 15 hours in total going through free code camp and mucking around on youtube learning different tricks. 


### How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?
3 x the speed i would guess




# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

Well there is no need to re-invent the wheel here so i'll just borrow from an analogy i heard while learning. There is a fence. The fence is plain and sturdy. The html would be like the fence, it is the structure. things like the Text and the language in the site. Then the CSS would be like the paint or styling, as it says in the name Cascading Style Sheet. As the fence is decorated by paint, the html is styled by the CSS. 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? 
To be honest i'm still facing quite a few obstacles. I still don't really understand shapes as much as i would like. I tried create a bunch of circles with text as a link in them and put them right next to each other in a line but coouldnt figure it out, and can't seem to find it in the course! 


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
Yes when things worked 


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

Html would be an ant, and CSS would be a peacock. Html is basic and does the work. Css looks great.
