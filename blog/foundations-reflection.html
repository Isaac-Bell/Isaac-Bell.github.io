  Reflection
  Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations -
  answer each of the following questions:

  What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?

  I don't know , there are no new concepts for me in the core learnings. I have been pretty overwhealmed during this
  course n barely keeping afloat. I think if anything, knowing the importance placed on core in this course, i have felt
  this from the facilitors n staff, in terms of support. It has been really refreshing.


  What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
  Learning something new is always a challenge! Learning programming is hard! There are many times where i have come
  against what feels like a wall. At these times i've often felt frustrated n started to question things. At these times
  where it only seems like i'm failing, having self-awareness (that i'm feeling this way) n pairing that with empathy
  (it's ok to feel this way) n values (what's important to me) has gently guided me back on the path.

  What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
  Like i said before, there haven't been any new concepts for me in this core learning, so i haven't been surprised.

  What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
  I've found it really challenging to reflect and write. I often feel i get a flood of words in my head and i'm not sure
  which ones to write out. It feels there's so many things i could write about, and in so many ways, that in the
  reflections time my brain has felt like it melting.

  Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
  Bootcamp course?
  Because at the end of this course, people are people looking people. Having technical skills is great but to make a
  great team, we need people skills!

  Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
  practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

  As much as i've struggled with writing relfections, i know it is really good for me. To be able to think about what
  i've been doing, learning, how i see myself and the world around me is important. As funny as it sounds, the times i
  do take to work on core, it somehow infuses me with an energy that helps me programme and think well in other areas of
  life too.
