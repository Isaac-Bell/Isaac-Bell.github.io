  <h2> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h2>
  <p> Since a young age, i've always loved learning. One of my favourite books was "How stuff works" that was given to
    me
    by
    Grandparents at 6 yeras old. Now this hasn't always been the traditional style of learning, mainly i
    found myself intrested in many random things n learning in my own way. As teenager leaving school, i knew in my
    heart
    i wanted to do something
    that would engage my thinking, but couldn't figure out what was. I remember thinking "If i can't figure out what to
    study at Uni i'll go building". It was either that or flight school, n i chose building. That was when i was about
    20
    years old. Now at 31, i have been in that industry for over 10 years now. Being trained in Carpentry n having also
    had
    experience project managing contruction projects has given me solid practial skills and given knowledge of how ideas
    can go from
    concept to completion. While in the construction industry there still plenty learning to be done, n growth n
    progression, it doesn't quiete offer now what i'm seeking, now something else in my heart. My dream now is to travel
    n
    work. Also being in the industry now for a while i feel i'm ready for a change, to learn something new! Now with
    this
    journey into tech, i'm ticking two boxes, learning , and gaining skills to work "remotely" for
    this travel dream. Also, remote work opens up opportunities to live in remote locations where the cost of living is
    lower. I hope that after this course i can go on a track for remote development, how ever best that looks, i'm yet
    to
    learn!</p>
