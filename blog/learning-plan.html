    <h2> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h2>
    <p> Since a young age, i've always loved learning. One of my favourite books was "How stuff works" that was given to
      me
      by
      Grandparents at 6 yeras old. Now this hasn't always been the traditional style of learning, mainly i
      found myself intrested in many random things n learning in my own way. As teenager leaving school, i knew in my
      heart
      i wanted to do something
      that would engage my thinking, but couldn't figure out what was. I remember thinking "If i can't figure out what
      to
      study at Uni i'll go building". It was either that or flight school, n i chose building. That was when i was about
      20
      years old. Now at 31, i have been in that industry for over 10 years now. Being trained in Carpentry n having also
      had
      experience project managing contruction projects has given me solid practial skills and given knowledge of how
      ideas
      can go from
      concept to completion. While in the construction industry there still plenty learning to be done, n growth n
      progression, it doesn't quiete offer now what i'm seeking, now something else in my heart. My dream now is to
      travel
      n
      work. Also being in the industry now for a while i feel i'm ready for a change, to learn something new! Now with
      this
      journey into tech, i'm ticking two boxes, learning , and gaining skills to work "remotely" for
      this travel dream. Also, remote work opens up opportunities to live in remote locations where the cost of living
      is
      lower. I hope that after this course i can go on a track for remote development, how ever best that looks, i'm yet
      to
      learn!</p>


    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h2>
    <p> </p>

    <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p> I hope that with the structured challenges n supportive framework that i can grow into a lifestye of finishing
      things well. Sometimes in the past when i've tried to learn new skills, i will start off with good enthusiasm but
      get lost or discouraged/ lose interest when i face challanges. With my dream being remote work, i know that as a
      hybrid student of Dev Academy, i will learn proper working habbits and good knowledge for skillset required for
      great success in this area </p>

    <h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators
      and
      industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h2>
    <p> I understand that in terms of work hours, Each day during foundations at least 6 - 8 hours is reqiured. I will
      commit 2 x 4 hr time slots, or 3 x 3 hr time slots for work. I work well first thing in the morning, and also in
      the
      evening. I may have some kind of break during the day after my morning study n come back to it in the afternoon. I
      will manage myself toward others always with respect and genuine interest in goodness.</p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </h2>
    <p>
      Keep being the stars that you are. I expect them to jst be awesome all around by doing their best for student
      success.
    </p>
    <h2> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
      might
      have
      whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p> I will have occasional commitments to some ongoing construction works as part of business that i'm still
      involved with, but with timeboxing i consider this will not interfere with my commitment for hours for this
      course.
