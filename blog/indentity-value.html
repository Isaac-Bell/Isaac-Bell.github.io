    <p> This one time, as an apprentice carpenter, i was working with a fella who had a mate who was a betting man. This
      man loved to take a punt on sports on bet365. This man lived in australia n actually did quiete well on the
      punting using a double down strategy he made $50k n got his account banned. This man was now looking for another
      person who would create an account for him, all he needed was an indentity to use and he could carry on his epic
      punting. So the falla i was working with said to me, how about he use your name to set up an account? The deal was
      sweetened by saying i could have %5 of the profits, with no risk to myself. I was not even tempted. Having a core
      value of integrity on my name gaurded me from this n i was happy to say no, to the amazement of both of the
      blokes. </p>

      Well, first of all, indenity is not something that can be changed but only discovered. Indenity is inherited. A
      son, a brother, a friend, a lover. All of these things are given not taken. The idea of changing who we are is the
      craziest idea i see going about, people trying to become something else. We only need to know who we really truly
      are. In terms of values, i'm glad to have an understanding of the true source of humanity being love. Not chaos.
      If we trace our lineage back enough generations what do we find? Monkeys or God?
