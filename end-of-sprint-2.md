# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
In some areas i would say 80% confident, others i feel i need a bit more practise with. I got so lost down rabbit holes for example using my own custom font i downloaded, or trying to position boxes i made using CSS took some practise. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
I felt capable when i was able to create multiple pages and style them with css. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
I was anxious when some things wouldn't work as expected. For example at the start i was able to use a custom font i downloaded in my webpage, them somehow during making the rest of it, it stopped working and i don't know why. 


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Self critical voice is saying i spend way to much time on small things, which is true. I also feel anxious to share my work with classmates after it seems i have put so much time into it and it looks so basic! 

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I would smile, and just say "with great skill and dexterity"
