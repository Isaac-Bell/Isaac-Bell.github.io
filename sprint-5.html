     <p> # My Reflections - Sprint Five 

          # Minesweeper
          
          <h2> ### What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you?</h2>
          
          Probably realising i needed to loop through the array to return the count surrounding mines, previous to this i was trying to use DOM event handlers, and onclick events. 
          
          <h2>### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?</h2>
          
          Yes i blocked during the aformention hard spot, after that it wasn't too hard
          
          <h2 ### What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?</h2>
          
          I think actually, getting help earlier is the best thing i could have done, as i was blocked for a very long time preventing me progressing. 
          
          <h2>### If _you_ were responsible for curriculum development at Dev Academy, would you change this challenge in any way? How? Why?</h2>
          
          
          I wouldn't know , i guess i got blocked early and needed help, but i don't know if i'm a special case. It wasnt very clear how to figure out the onclick return surrounding mines function..
          
          
          
           <h2># Pair Programming
          
          ### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
          No, nothing, i come from a building background building houses. 
          
          
          
          <h2> ### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so? </h2>
          
          Yes and no. I find sometimes its hard for me to voice my feelings. But generally i get along great with people. 
          
          
          </p>

     <h1> Core Reflections </h1>
 

      <h2>  What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h2>   
      <p> Some of the key things that stood out to me was the neuroplacity topic. Sometimes in my life i've thought i'm past my learning date (since i'm not a kid 
           anymore it will be hard for me to learn.) This content really reinforces the idea that if i want to learn something enough, I can! </p>

      <h2>   What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>   
      <p>Similar to what i mentioned above i think, is the value of kindness. Kindess to others and self allows space to learn. When I don't know something
            I don't get upset if i'm kind to myself, I just say I need to give myelf a chance to learn these things, I just need to give my brain more time to
             come to terms with this. I think self awareness of my inner critic can be good too, in terms of my effort. Am i putting enough effort in? Can I do more? 
          Often the two can go hand in hand to birth joyful productivity. </p>

      <h2>    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>   
      <p> To be honest, alot of the content I've already read books about, and was one of the things that attracted my friend to the enspiral group, which is how we are good friends. I love the style of learning that EDA presents.  </p>

      <h2>    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>   
      <p> To be honest, probably the relfections. Although the content wasn't new to me, i havn't been required to talk about it before like this, and in that sense thinking and refelcting on how the conent impacts has been good for me but challenging.  </p>

      <h2>   Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>   
      <p> Because at the end of the day, the world is full of people. Our work collegues are people, the clients are people. Without people skills as coders we are missing a big piece of the puzzle! </p>

      <h2>   Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>   
      <p> Well, from my above answer it would seem crazy to try explain that it's a waste of time!  </p>
