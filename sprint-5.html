          # Minesweeper
          
          <h2> ### What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you?</h2>
          
          Probably realising i needed to loop through the array to return the count surrounding mines, previous to this i was trying to use DOM event handlers, and onclick events. 
          
          <h2>### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?</h2>
          
          Yes i blocked during the aformention hard spot, after that it wasn't too hard
          
          <h2 ### What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?</h2>
          
          I think actually, getting help earlier is the best thing i could have done, as i was blocked for a very long time preventing me progressing. 
          
          <h2>### If _you_ were responsible for curriculum development at Dev Academy, would you change this challenge in any way? How? Why?</h2>
          
          
          I wouldn't know , i guess i got blocked early and needed help, but i don't know if i'm a special case. It wasnt very clear how to figure out the onclick return surrounding mines function..
          
          
          
           <h2># Pair Programming
          
          ### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
          No, nothing, i come from a building background building houses. 
          
          
          
          <h2> ### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so? </h2>
          
          Yes and no. I find sometimes its hard for me to voice my feelings. But generally i get along great with people.
