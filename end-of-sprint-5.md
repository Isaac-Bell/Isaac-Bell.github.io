# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Do you feel more or less confident in your JavaScript skills after this sprint? What made you feel this?



### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Completing my first website, well at least getting links with CSS working. It was nice, even though it doesn't look the best i like that it worked. And i loved using the CMD line to move files around . Felt like a hacker you know. 

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?
Probably finding the minesweeper SO hard. I had no idea how to solve some of it and felt bad i didn't know earlier. 


### What did you think Foundations was going to be like before you started?
I had no idea really. I just figured it would be challenging but good, i was right. 



### What was Foundations actually like?




### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

Only in the times where i felt blocked, but i guess thats normal. What kept me going is my drive to complete what i've started, and all the reasons i signed up arn't going to go away from being blocked on one problem. 


### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

REALLY UNPREPRARED. Feel nervous, but READY TO GO , can't wait for it to start. Just wanna do it and smash it. 


### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?
I would say, ask for help sooner. The tutors are there to help and so are your classmates. Don't be so self critical. 



### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

no lol. Because it was so challenging for me to figure out the logic for the minesweeper...
