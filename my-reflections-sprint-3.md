# Mindfulness 

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? 
Yes


### Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   

Yes

### What did you notice as you were meditating? 

I feel peacefull but bored

### How did you find the overall experience? 

boring but kind of peaceful

### What's your daily habit commitment? 
    
I really don't like it but i'll give it a go each morning with my wife who has already previously downloaded and paid for a full subscirbtion 



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

It was kinda weird, i almost ran out of things to say 

### What was it like to fully listen?
Painful lol, more for the other person trying to talk for that long 
    




# Learning JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? 
My learning style is i can read for a bit but if i don't use what i'm reading after a while i can get a bit lost specially when it involves alot of thing to do like functions. I tried another practise coding website out that really helped me practise what i was learning on freecodecamp.  https://edabit.com/ . 


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I really tried to this week considering the huge amount of time i spent last week. If i did go over it was more because i was trying to master the basics. 

### If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  


Because i haven't written much code, some of the syntax of calling objects and functions didn't make sense until i could see it in action so i got stuck there a bit . 


# The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer

### Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?

SO BORED. I think that i still don't understand the importance of understanding the call functions in the console of the DOM when i can use the selector tool to select the elements. The interesting part was obviously its a very important concept to understand what process browsers employ to produce a sensible webpage out of the code . 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

Funny enough only 5, and i can honestly say they are all study related! 



# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?



### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?



### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.
