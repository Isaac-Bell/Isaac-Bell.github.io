# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability Primer

### What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?
Code readability is a method of indentation. Each child of an element should be intented to clearly show what's going on!
I will try the two space tab indentation method for all my sub elements. 


### Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.
Very important! From everything i have read, when code is written by a developer, chances are they are not the only ones who will read it. So to improve
the experience for everyone, it would help if reading it wasn't the hard part! Studies have shown that developers spend about 9/10ths of the time reading, and only 1/10 writing code. 




# Code Readability Challenge

### As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?

Very important as described above. No one loves a sloppy code 

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

I answered above

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?

I learnt over the years that if i keep my workspace clean, my thoughts are clearer since my brain is not cluttered. I feel there is a direct relation to my workspace
and my mental space. 



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 

function actualSum () {
    return 7;
}


### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?

Um after reading one short article on it i don't really understand it fully yet so its hard to answer

### How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?
From what i've read so far, if you are writing code that is answering test questions you have made, you are creating tick boxes and then ticking them with actual tests, so in that way the reliability of the code is tested as part of the proccess. 


### Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?
I thought oh yeah this makes sense, and thought it would help to think of how to code something efficiently too. 




# Repl.it - Code in your browser

### What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?
I was excited to be able to test hings


### How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?


Useful
### When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?


Lol, Repell-i.t 

# Problem Solving and Pseudocode 

### Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?



### How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?






# JavaScript Variables and Object Types

### How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?

At first i didn't understand the task, but then i understood that i was teaching me test driven developement and then it was almost like doing a test looking at the answers!

### Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?
Of course... to get the information. I guess i could have recorded all the info in one go but i just went number by number 




# Manipulating JavaScript Objects

### What was the highlight of this kata for you?



### Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?





# FizzBuzz (Super Edition)

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?



### How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?





# JavaScript Gradebook

### What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?



### Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?





# Built-in Methods

### On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata? 




### What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?






<!-- Stretch Material -->

# JavaScript Olympics

### Did you find this took a longer or shorter time than you expected? Why?



### If you were to complete the kata again, what would you do differently next time?
