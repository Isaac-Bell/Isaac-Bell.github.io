          <h2> Research Neuroplasticity </h2>

          <h2> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people </h2> 
                <p>
                    "'He who says he can and he who says he can't are both usually right " - Confucius. Neuroplascity is the idea that the brain 
                    can learn and form and strengthen new connections as opposed to being static and unchanging. For years the idea of intelligence
                     has been "either you've got it or you don't". Some innate attribute that some people are born with, or not... Going through life,
                      studies have shown that people who believe that they arn't very intelligent for whatever reason will not as readily take on new 
                      challenges and therfore new opportunities. Neuroplacity says that those people instead of being static with either having 
                      intelligence or not, can actually grow and learn in any skill they put their mind too. The studies have shown that new information is 
                      recieved as real physical "real-estate" in the brain that looks like a small ball, and that when called upon will be strengthened with
                       proteins between the trees that are calling them.  The more that this new information is used, the more the new cell will resemble a 
                       tree and be connected to other cells within the brain, creating a network of understanding. People who understand the science of the 
                       brain can understand that although a task or a new skill might be a big task to learn, it is possible with enough practise! 
                </p> 
          <h2> Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h2> 
               <p>
                    If i can remember that my brain needs practise, and repitition to solidy new ideas and information, i think it will remind me
                     to give myself the patience that i need when i don't understand. Often if i'm learning something new, i want to understand 
                     it quickly, and if i don't , sometimes i can move on. But understanding this function of the brain brings about a patient 
                     hope that given the right conditions i will understand and can be really great! 
               </p>

          <h2> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity.</h2> 
               <p>
                    Learn more and learn often! The brain is a muscle and the more you fire the neurons through deliberate practise and learning 
                    of new things the faster it can form and strengthen new connections.

          <h2> Research Growth Mindset.</h2> 
          <br>
          <br> 
          <h2> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
               <p>
                    The same as i discussed above! 
               </p> 
          <h2> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?.</h2> 
               <p>
                    I love these concepts so much, thankfully i have previously heard of the growth mindset and have read a few books on the 
                    subject. Although i've always had a pretty strong believe i can do anything i put my mind to (thankfully i was taught this)
                     learning the growth mindset again as an adult really strengthens this idea that if you want something bad enough, go get it!
                      So more than anything it strengthens my resolve to put in the work required to be great. 
               </p> 
          <h2> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?.</h2> 
               <p>
                    Same as discussed above really, be patient with myself, and give my self every opportunity to learn by knowing what my brain 
                    needs to grow. Time, repitition, food, rest.
